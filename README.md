#Graph Ledger Protocol
A permissionless protocol for representing assertions, evidence, and contradictions in a distributed event graph.
The system does not decide what is true.
It provides a canonical, content-addressed ledger of claims and relations from which stability emerges through structure, time, and cost.
This repository contains the protocol specification only.
It is not a platform, not a service, and not a governance system.
Key properties:
Immutable event log (CBOR-canonical, content-addressed)
Cost-based spam resistance (PoW / stake / rate policies)
Typed semantic relations (supports, contradicts, refines, …)
Plural client-side interpretation (no global truth metric)
Current status: Specification v0.2 (draft)
