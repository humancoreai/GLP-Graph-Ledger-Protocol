#Graph Ledger Protocol
A permissionless protocol for representing assertions, evidence, and contradictions in a distributed event graph.
The system does not decide what is true.
It provides a canonical, content-addressed ledger of claims and relations from which stability emerges through structure, time, and cost.
This repository contains the protocol specification only.
It is not a platform, not a service, and not a governance system.
Key properties:
Immutable event log (CBOR-canonical, content-addressed)
Cost-based spam resistance (PoW / stake / rate policies)
Typed semantic relations (supports, contradicts, refines, …)
Plural client-side interpretation (no global truth metric)
Current status: Specification v0.2 (draft)

No entity owns the graph.
Open participation is the default.
Power is never embedded in the.    protocol.
Ownership of truth is structurally impossible.
Whoever speaks must pay cost, not receive privilege.
Every claim stands or falls by its relations.
Revision happens by addition, not deletion.
Forks are legitimate, not rebellions.
Opinions cannot be suppressed, only countered.
Robustness comes from diversity, not control.
Actors are measured by behavior, not status.
No whitelist exists.
Your client chooses your lens.
Others may choose differently.
No global authority is required.
Everything remains verifiable.
